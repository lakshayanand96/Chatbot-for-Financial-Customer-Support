  utter_cards:
  - text: "LOW RATE CREDIT CARD - A low rate credit card typically offers a lower interest rate on purchases. This type of credit card can be useful if you think you may have to carry a balance – that’s the money you owe – from one month to another. While these cards have a lower interest rate, you may have to pay an annual fee.
           REWARDS CREDIT CARD - Some credit cards offer cashback or other rewards for everyday spending, like air miles or shopping vouchers, when you use them. They may have a higher interest rate or an annual fee, so try to work out whether the rewards will outweigh the costs.
           0% PURCHASE CREDIT CARD - Some cards offer periods of 0% interest on purchases. These can be useful if you plan to buy a big ticket item and pay for it upfront, giving you a fixed period of time to repay without being charged interest. keep in mind that once the 0% interest period ends the purchase interest rate will change. Make sure to look at this so you know what you’re in for down the track.
           BALANCE TRANSFER CREDIT CARD - Some cards offer 0% interest for a fixed time period for balance transfers from other cards. These allow you to transfer the debt for a small percentage fee of the amount you're transferring. This can be helpful if it means you’ll pay less interest and fees overall Like the 0% purchase card, this 0% interest period will end – so, ideally, you should try to clear your debt before it does. It’s also worth looking at what the rate will change to so you know what you’re in for over the longer term.
           CREDIT BUILDER CARD - If you have little, or no, credit history because you’ve not borrowed much in the past, then these cards can help you build your credit score. Interest rates may be higher than other types of cards, but you can avoid interest as long as you pay off your balance in full each month.
           TRAVEL CREDIT CARD - If you travel a lot, a travel credit card can make it cheaper for you to spend money overseas. They usually don’t charge a fee for making purchases or withdrawing cash overseas. Travel credit cards tend to have good exchange rates and some may offer reward points for spending. Interest rates may be higher than other types of cards, but you can avoid interest if you pay off your balance in full each month.
           A MONEY TRANSFER CREDIT CARD - Lets you move money from your credit card into your current account, for a fee. You may consider a money transfer credit card if you wanted to pay off an overdraft, for example. This is different from a balance transfer credit card, where you move debt from one credit card to another."

  - text: You can now pay in a cheque using the Mobile Banking App. The individual cheque limit is £500 and you can pay in up to £750 worth of cheques each day.

  utter_Charges:
  - text: There are 3 types of default fees you could face – late fees, over-limit fees and returned payment fees. If you're late paying your minimum monthly payment, you'll be charged a late fee of £12, which will appear on your next statement. If you receive a refund to your account, it won’t count towards the minimum monthly payment. You must still pay the full minimum amount, unless the refund reduces the balance to less than the minimum payment. How you could avoid a late fee? To avoid a late payment fee, you could set up a Direct Debit. This means that the payment would be taken automatically each month. You can choose to set a Direct Debit to pay the minimum amount, a fixed amount or the full balance. Plus, you can also make additional payments as well as having a Direct Debit. Set up a Direct Debit. OVER-LIMIT FEE £12. If you go over your agreed credit limit, you'll be charged an over-limit fee of £12, which will appear on your next statement. We'll apply the fee when you're first over the limit in any month. How you could avoid an over-limit fee? To avoid going over your agreed credit limit, you could review your current limit and consider asking us to increase it. Think carefully about whether you need a higher limit, as this could increase the risk of borrowing too much, which could cost you more or take longer to pay off. Change your credit limit. RETURNED PAYMENT FEE £5. If a payment from your Direct Debit or cheque is rejected, you'll be charged a returned payment fee of £5, which will appear on your next statement. How you could avoid a returned payment fee? A returned payment fee could be due to insufficient funds in your account. You could consider changing the date of your statement and payment date, so that it's on a more convenient day of the month for you.

If you haven't – or if you've gone past your arranged limit – it's known as an unarranged overdraft. Most of our accounts come with an interest-free buffer.
